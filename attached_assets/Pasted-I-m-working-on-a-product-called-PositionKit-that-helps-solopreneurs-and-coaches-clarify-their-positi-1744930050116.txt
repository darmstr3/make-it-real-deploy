I'm working on a product called PositionKit that helps solopreneurs and coaches clarify their positioning and messaging. I already have a working version of the app (like the one in the screenshot) that generates 3 positioning statements based on a short form.

Now I want to rebuild the app with a much better user flow and final output.

Please help me generate a new version using HTML/CSS/JS (or React if easier), where:

1. The form is replaced with a step-by-step experience:
   - Only **one question per screen**
   - Each step should show:
     - the question (e.g. ‚ÄúWhat do you do?‚Äù)
     - a 1-sentence explanation of why it matters
     - an example in light gray placeholder text

2. The updated question list:
   - What do you do? (Simple description of your work)
   - What service or offer are you currently selling?
   - What outcome or transformation do you deliver?
   - What niche or audience do you serve?
   - What are common pain points they experience daily?
   - What do people misunderstand or undervalue about what you do?

3. After they complete all steps, generate these outputs using OpenAI API (or simulate with placeholders):
   - Website headline
   - Instagram or LinkedIn bio
   - CTA phrase with subheadline
   - 1-paragraph summary of what they do and who they serve

4. Show the results on screen with a clear heading and:
   - üì• Download Word doc button
   - üìß Option to enter their email and receive the results (use Resend or a placeholder function)

5. Log their answers and output in Airtable via API (or simulate it with console logs for now). Include:
   - timestamp
   - each answer they gave
   - whether they downloaded or requested via email

6. Design notes:
   - Keep it clean and modern like Apple or Notion
   - Use subtle progress indicator or ‚ÄúStep X of 6‚Äù
   - Let the final results screen feel like a deliverable
   - Include "Regenerate" button to re-run the flow

This is NOT just a quiz or copy-paste tool. It should feel like a smart tool that helps users think clearly and walk away with usable positioning assets. It should feel like an assistant, not a gimmick.

Please generate the complete frontend and backend logic to run this inside Replit.
